## Overview
RadonPy is the first open-source Python library for fully automated calculation for a comprehensive set of polymer properties, using all-atom classical MD simulations. For a given polymer repeating unit with its chemical structure, the entire process of the MD simulation can be carried out fully automatically, including molecular modelling, equilibrium and non-equilibrium MD simulations, automatic determination of the completion of equilibration, scheduling of restarts in case of failure to converge, and property calculations in the post-process step. In this first release, the library comprises the calculation of 15 properties, such as thermal conductivity, density, specific heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, refractive index, and so on, at the amorphous state.
